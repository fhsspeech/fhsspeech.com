I’ve stuck with Congress since my freshman year, which has allowed me to learn from state, districts, and nationals. Additionally, I regularly compete in U.S Extemp, where I’ve also competed locally and nationally. Although my specialty is most useful in the lens of debate and limited prep, I have some familiarity with Interp as well. I hope to be a good resource for anyone who needs it, and I’m excited to be one of the 2021-2022 Speech&Debate leaders! You can contact me through terhuken000@hsestudents.org and (317)847-7760.
