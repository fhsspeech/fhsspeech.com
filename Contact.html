This is my 4th year of speech and over the years, I’ve done Extemp and Info. I started speech my freshman year because I enjoyed it in junior high, but I was greeted with an entirely different experience. Being a part of speech team fosters individuality, confidence and it’s the epitome of how to grow as a team. Outside of speech, my hobbies and pastimes include reading, coding, listening to music and spending time with friends. I’m looking forward to an amazing new season with you all! My contact is manvi.veera@gmail.com if you need me.

I’ve stuck with Congress since my freshman year, which has allowed me to learn from state, districts, and nationals. Additionally, I regularly compete in U.S Extemp, where I’ve also competed locally and nationally. Although my specialty is most useful in the lens of debate and limited prep, I have some familiarity with Interp as well. I hope to be a good resource for anyone who needs it, and I’m excited to be one of the 2021-2022 Speech&Debate leaders! You can contact me through terhuken000@hsestudents.org and (317)847-7760.
