On the speech side, I can specialize in most platform events since Iâ€™ve done Poetry and Original Performance, but I also competed in Public Forum Debate last year! When Iâ€™m not giving speeches or debating I like to play guitar and piano and watch whatever videos Youtube suggests. Iâ€™m excited to help others enjoy, improve, and thrive in our team this year, so if you have any questions or comments, you can contact me at kaelyntai5622@gmail.com.

This is my 3rd year of speech and over the years, Iâ€™ve done Extemp and Info. I hope to try out debate this year if possible and maybe OO as well. I started speech my freshman year because I enjoyed it in junior high, but I was greeted with an entirely different experience. Being a part of speech team fosters individuality, confidence and itâ€™s the epitome of how to grow as a team. Outside of speech, my hobbies and pastimes include reading, coding, listening to music and spending time with friends. Iâ€™m looking forward to an amazing new season with you all!
