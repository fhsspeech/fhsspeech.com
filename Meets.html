				<li>All skirts and dresses must be knee length, and check the fit. You do not want a fit that is too tight.</li>

				<li>If you choose to wear a skirt or dress you MUST wear panty hose or tights. Only nude or black hose are allowed. No cut outs or runs allowed. </li>
				<li>Heels are not to be higher than three inches, remember you need to be able to walk with grace and perform well! Heels should not be thin either, and wider heels are recommended. Also remember you CAN wear flats and we highly suggest them!</li>
				<li>No bracelets or rings at all. Make sure necklaces are not noisy or distracting and your earrings should not dangle. Ankle bracelets that show are not allowed.</li>

				<li>We highly suggest a full suit, but a sport coat and slacks is also acceptable.</li>
				<li>Dress shoes only! And make sure you are wearing the correct color socks.</li>
