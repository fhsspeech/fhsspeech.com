I have done POI, Prose, Original Performance and Info. I honestly joined speech because it would look good on a college application but I do it now because it’s a chance for my voice to get heard. I can talk about things that I’m passionate about and things that are important to me. I can educate people and change their opinions. Ultimately, to me speech is a privilege where I can use my talent to inform people about things that matter. And I can help anyone who does public address and Interp. so feel free to reach out to me! My email is tnajum000@gmail.com!
